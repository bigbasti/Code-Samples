Fill-IT
=======
This is a java clone of the iphone game "Flood it".
I used it as a java learning project back in 2009.

Goal
----
Your goal is to fill the playground with the same color. Everytime you select a color from one of the colors at the 
botom you change the color of the square at the upper left corner and all neighbour squares if they have the same color.

Try to solve the "puzzle" in under 22 clicks :)
